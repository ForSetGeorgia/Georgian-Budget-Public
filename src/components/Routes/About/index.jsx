However,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>the codes of a Spending Agency and Program can change at any time.</span><span className="c3">&nbsp;It is possible for a new Spending Agency or Program to be assigned a code of a previous Spending Agency or Program. If the previous Spending Agency or Program still exists, it has now been assigned a new code. This means that we cannot simply match the code from each spreadsheet and assume it is for the same Spending Agency or Program.</span></p><p className="c1 c6"><span className="c3"></span></p><p className="c1"><span>On top of that, Spending Agency and Program names constantly change, even within a year.</span><span>&nbsp;so using the combination of code and name is also not a perfect way to match records from each spreadsheet.</span></p><h4 className="c17" id="h.ixyl2bog6e3m"><span>Our Solution</span></h4><p className="c1"><span>We programmatically attempt to match records from one time period to another by looking for records that have the same code and name.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p className="c1 c6"><span className="c3"></span></p><p className="c1"><span>W</span><span>hen this approach does not find a match, we have to manually </span><span>determine </span><span>which record</span><span>s correspond to one another. This occurs, for example, when we identify two records that have the same code but different names. </span></p><p className="c1 c6"><span className="c3"></span></p><p className="c1"><span>Given this</span><span>&nbsp;process</span><span>, human error is possible</span><span>.
